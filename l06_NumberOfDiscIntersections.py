We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N âˆ’ 1. An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J â‰  K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.
