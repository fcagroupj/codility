In this problem we consider unsigned 30-bit integers, i.e. all integers B such that 0 â‰¤ B < 230.

We say that integer A conforms to integer B if, in all positions where B has bits set to 1, A has corresponding bits set to 1.

Write a function with python:

def solution(A, B, C)

that, given three unsigned 30-bit integers A, B and C, returns the number of unsigned 30-bit integers conforming to at least one of the given integers.
